# Monday
**Shnarcle** is a rock gnome, 37 two feet tall 40 pounds, hairless, but has moss for hair instead.

**Rar Summerfang** rogue urchin. Robin hood style guy

**Lillith** is a Tiefling, cleric who worships the god of endurance

We start in a tavern, and introduced ourselves. After, we look around the tavern and find a few old men around the tavern, some young ones and a tall elf with long black hair and pearly white skin and a piercing gaze. Holds a very piercing gaze. 

**Shnarcle** offends him by trying to get a name out of the elf, however, the elf wants to remain anonymous. **Lillith** tries to make amends by apologizing.

The elf talks about how a drunk in the corner says his farm has been attacked from something in the haunted wood.

The elf gives a short speech about how he has been around for a long time, And how he loves **Dragonview**

Shnarcle finally annoys **Sarcus**(the elf) enough to give his name.

**Aldrech** is the guy at the bar(drunk), who lost his farm
One night he was sleeping, and woke up to dogs barking. (Doesn't own dogs so was confused ) Saw large things that were not quite dogs. He hid under bed
In his storytelling he *starts to get emotional* and tell us how his sheep were gone. He has given up because his they were his livelihood (refused to fight when we offered help avenging his sheep). We then offer to do it with out him and he is very grateful, but confused why we would do this. We say **Sarcaus** would reward us. Aldrech obviously holds **Sarcaus** in high esteem and gets exited when we mentioned him

He tells us his farm is 
>"Out of the city and across the lake is a river, it is marked with a path which leads to my farm"

 He succoms to his drunkenness and passes out
**Shnarkle** very emotional about drinking and tries to convince bartender to never give **Aldrech** any alcohol again. However, **Aldrech** is their best customer, so they obviously refuse.
# Tuesday 
We all agree to go avenge **Aldrechs** sheep
We wake at dawn and meet together at the beginning of the path

And it was very foggy and we didn't make it as far as we could have
# Wednesday
Next day we find we were only a mile away from the farm. It is a very sunny day

Farmhouse seems to be little harmed, no burns and surprisingly large. Very well established and rich but an old design. About sixty feet across and a little well in front of the house. There is a cart in front, and is the only thing that is not pristine (in front of the house) and is torn apart.

**Lillith** and **Murbrek** investigate the broken cart with Murbrek standing guard

**Lillith** looks inside the cart (which seems recently used) and finds a broken mushroom which seemed to have grown here, despite being newly used cart(3-4 inches across mushroom) brown and white fans on the base

**Shnarkle** walks up to the window of the house and tries to look through it(can't reach because he is 2 1/2 feet tall and the window is about 3 feet tall) attempts to push box up to window to stand up on
**Shnarkle** sees a table and wooden benches, work bench, fireplace, dressers, and a door to another room. He calls out to the party about what he sees.

**Shnarkle** can't reach the door and asks **Murbrek** to open it. The door is locked and **Rar** attempts to pick it and fails. **Shnarkle** attempts to smash a window and also fails(splintering the glass)

**Rar** tries again to pick the lock again and succeeds. We all walk in and there is a lot of dust(doesn't make sense as **Aldrech** supposedly only left yesterday)

We find the same room **Shnarkle** saw through the window, only there is another door too the right he didn't quite see.
We cross the room, into one of the two doors(the one **Shnarkle** saw before) and find two knolls(ork but darker with a wolf head) and **Shnarkle** attacks with a short sword. Battle ensues

One knoll is suspiciously already wounded, and appears have been sleeping before we barged in

Two more knolls come in from behind us, one from outside the house and one from the closet on the right.

After killing all knolls, we discover each have a unique trident like symbol on each knolls shoulder

We also find a simple drawn map on the knolls corpse
