  description: "We make our way to the [Aldridge farm](Aldridge%20farm.md), and discover it is strangely untouched. There is a half inch layer of dust, despite [Aldrech](Aldrech.md) supposedly only leaving a couple days before. We find three knolls inside the building, and one comes in from behind us."
